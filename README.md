# Website Marketing Analysis

## Overview

This project analyzes the effectiveness of various marketing campaigns on website performance metrics. The focus is on understanding the impact of different marketing channels on Click-Through Rate (CTR), Conversion Rate, Website Visits, Pages Per Visit, and Time Spent on Site, segmented by gender.

## Objectives

- **Investigate the relationship between website visits and conversion rates.**
- **Analyze the combined effect of website visits and time spent on the website on conversion rates.**
- **Identify the best marketing channels for different performance metrics based on gender.**

## Findings

### Relationship Between Website Visits and Conversion Rate

Statistical analysis indicates that an increase in website visits correlates with a higher conversion rate. However, the time spent on the website does not significantly impact the conversion rate.

### Combined Effect of Website Visits and Time Spent on Website

- **F-Statistic:** 0.8666 (relatively low)
- **P-Value:** 0.420 (greater than the significance level of 0.3)

This combination suggests that the model using both TimeOnSite and WebsiteVisits to predict ConversionRate does not provide strong evidence that these variables together reliably predict visitor conversions.

### Best Campaign Channel by Metric and Gender

- **Click-Through Rate (CTR):**
  - **Female:** PPC campaign performs best.
  - **Male:** Social Media campaign performs best.

- **Conversion Rate:**
  - **Female:** Social Media campaign performs best.
  - **Male:** Social Media campaign performs best.

- **Website Visits:**
  - **Female:** Email campaign attracts more visits.
  - **Male:** Social Media campaign attracts more visits.

- **Pages Per Visit:**
  - **Female:** PPC campaign results in more pages per visit.
  - **Male:** Social Media campaign results in more pages per visit.

- **Time Spent on Site:**
  - **Female:** Social Media campaign leads to longer time on site.
  - **Male:** PPC campaign leads to longer time on site.

## Conclusion

The analysis provides insights into the effectiveness of various marketing channels based on different performance metrics and gender. The results highlight the importance of tailoring marketing strategies to optimize for specific outcomes.
